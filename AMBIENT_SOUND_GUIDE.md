# 🔊 Ambient Sound Feature Guide

## How It Works

The vibe coding experience now includes **procedural ambient sounds** generated using the Web Audio API. No audio files needed - all sounds are created in real-time!

## Available Ambient Sounds

1. **⌨️ Keyboard** - Realistic typing sounds for focus mode
2. **🌧️ Rain** - Soothing white noise filtered to sound like rain
3. **☕ Cafe** - Coffee shop ambience with background chatter
4. **🌲 Forest** - Nature sounds with occasional bird calls

## How to Use

1. **Open Vibe Controls**: Click the 🎛️ button in the top-right
2. **Adjust Sound Level**: Move the "Ambient Sound" slider above 0%
3. **Choose Sound Type**: Select from the 4 ambient sound options
4. **Try Presets**: Each preset has a different ambient sound:
   - 🎯 **Focus** → Keyboard typing (15% volume)
   - 😌 **Chill** → Rain sounds (40% volume)  
   - ⚡ **Energy** → Cafe ambience (60% volume)
   - 🌙 **Midnight** → Forest sounds (25% volume)

## Technical Details

- **Procedural Generation**: All sounds are created using Web Audio API oscillators, filters, and noise generators
- **No Files Required**: Everything is generated in the browser - no audio files to download
- **Real-time Control**: Volume and sound type change instantly
- **Browser Compatibility**: Works in all modern browsers that support Web Audio API

## Troubleshooting

**Can't hear anything?**
- Make sure your browser volume is up
- Check that the sound slider is above 0%
- Some browsers require user interaction before playing audio - try clicking a preset button
- Ensure your browser supports Web Audio API (all modern browsers do)

**Sounds choppy or distorted?**
- Try lowering the volume
- Close other audio-heavy browser tabs
- The procedural generation is CPU-intensive - performance may vary on older devices

## How It's Built

The ambient sound system uses:
- **Web Audio API** for sound generation
- **Oscillators** for tones and frequencies  
- **Noise Generators** for white/pink noise effects
- **Filters** to shape the sound (lowpass, highpass, etc.)
- **Gain Nodes** for volume control
- **Zustand Store** for state management

Each sound type has its own generation algorithm:
- **Rain**: Filtered white noise with lowpass filter
- **Keyboard**: Periodic square wave bursts with random timing
- **Cafe**: Combination of ambient noise + periodic "chatter" tones
- **Forest**: Filtered noise + random bird call oscillators

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
- More ambient sound types (ocean, city, etc.)
- Sound mixing (combine multiple ambient types)
- Audio file support for higher quality sounds
- Spatial audio effects
- User-customizable sound parameters
